# MyDoorTestProject

The screen is a list of doors that can be opened by clicking on the cell.
At the start of the application, simulate the loading of the door list API within 2-3 seconds.
When clicking on a cell, the door should assume an "Unlocking..." status for 3 seconds, then an "Unlocked" status for 3 seconds, then the original "Locked" status.
